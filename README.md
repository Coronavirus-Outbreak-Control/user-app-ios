# COVID-19 Herd Immunity

IOS application to anonymously track interactions among people to alert if anyone had contacts with an infected person.
This will help us to develop herd immunity by sending precise instructions to people who had contacts with an infected person.

The instructions could inform the person to stay home, wash his/her hands and to call a specif phone number if he/she feels sick, wihtout going to the hospital.

We hope that this will help us to fight the COVID-19 virus by reducing its k-factor (R0) through a drastical and cheap reduction of the contact-rate.
